      <h4>My story</h4>
      <p>  My name is Jacob Hallman. I was born and raised here in the beautiful san jauquin valley. I grew up in Shaver Lake, CA I graduated from Sierra High School in 1997. Straight to college I went. Fresno City was my destination, football was my passion. I played for coach Stanley. The 4th game I was injured. Regretingly, I stopped playing and Dropped out of school.
      In 1999 I took a job with RSS(Retail Store Services). I worked in 5 different Home Depot's from Merced to Visalia. I was in charge of 2 multi-million $ product lines. Hunter, and Hampton Bay fans. I went to one store each day and took care of everything for those lines. I credited stores for damaged products, replaced all light bulbs, switched out older products, and gave customer service to all that asked. After 10 months with RSS, I was convinced to go back to school.</p>
      <p>  In 2000 I started school at IT Technical Institute in Fresno. I studied Electronic Communications. I took a job with Comcast directly after my schooling was completed. I worked there over 12 years. I did it all! Installer, service tech, dispatcher, customer education consultant, quality tech, alarm tech, field supervisor, tech manager(80+ techs). I learned alot about customer service from that job. Going in 6-10 different peoples homes each day, very interesting.
      January 2013 was the last time I had a job. I went through the EDC and in Febuary 2015 I was given the oppritunity to attend the FIRST, six-month Web Developer course at Geekwise Academy. Since then I have fallen in love with CODE. I drove 110 mile round-trip everyday to attend class. I believe I showed dedication and determination in completing this course. I also believe I have the gumption, and willingness to succeed in this industry.</p>
